Hello World! 

To compile my program, you need to include all of these files: 

Map.h 
Map.cpp 
firstMeet.txt 
endOfRegion.txt 
NPC_talks.txt 
fightTalk.txt
mainP3Driver.cpp 
playerClass.h 
playerClass.cpp 
waterClass.h 
waterClass.cpp 
fireClass.h 
fireClass.cpp 
earthClass.h 
earthClass.cpp 
airClass.h 
airClass.cpp 
NormieClass.h 
NormieClass.cpp 
randMaker.h

- Please email me at aarondbarrios@gmail.com if you are unable to run. 

- I was given the map classes and drivers by my class instructors, and made the rest myself. 

- There are a couple of things I could've included that would've made the game much better- saving your game file, making a make
file, etc. I can assure you, they were much more issues of ignorance than of interest! 

- However, you will find that from the inputs of many an eager tester, it is quite well polished, in terms of user input errors/unintended bugs.

- And finally, even if you aren't a superflous dialogue enjoyer, I still hope you have as much fun playing it as I had making it!
